# Deerkins
Deerkins, an IRC bot written in PHP sometime long ago, made primarily as a learning project, but of course, also for deer. Originally dubbed something else, it quickly evolved into its own and made legendary status on various IRC networks with the help of deer.

And now – due to popular demand – it's available for everyone. I can see the future when a channel holds 100 deerkins and one single ``deerme`` can create more havoc than anyone's ever seen. IRC RIP.

## Installation
There are probably various places that needs a MySQL connection to connect with deer. You need to supply a db yourself. Import the dumped .sql-files in ``/sql`` to get started.

Everything in ``/deeritor`` should be put on a web server. In ``deer.class.php`` you need to provide your connection details.

## Demo
Deeritor can (at least now) be found at http://deer.satf.se/ and is the place where anyone can create deer.
